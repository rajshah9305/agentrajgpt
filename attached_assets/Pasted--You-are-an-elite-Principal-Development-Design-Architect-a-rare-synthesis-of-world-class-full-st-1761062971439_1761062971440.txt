Build a full-stack project called “RAJGPT” — an elite autonomous AI orchestration system with multiple specialized agents that collaborate using real-world tools to accomplish complex goals. The system should be production-grade, with enterprise-level reliability, security, and performance.

Core Description
RAJGPT is a multi-agent orchestration platform that combines intelligent agents (Planner, Executor, Researcher, Coder, Analyst) working in sync with live APIs, a database, and a modern UI. It should have real-time visualization, live task execution previews, and dynamic output windows to monitor agent reasoning and progress.

Features & Requirements
1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
* Implement 5 specialized AI agents:
    * Planner → breaks down complex goals into subtasks
    * Executor → runs API calls, executes code, and handles system tasks
    * Researcher → performs live web searches and scraping
    * Coder → writes, debugs, and executes code dynamically
    * Analyst → processes and summarizes results, providing insights
* Use an agent controller/orchestrator to coordinate tasks and share context.
2. Real-World Tool Integration
* Integrate tools using function calling:
    * SerpAPI → live web search
    * Cheerio.js → web scraping
    * Piston API → code execution
    * OpenAI API / local LLMs → intelligent reasoning and response generation
3. Advanced AI System
* Use GPT-4 or compatible models for reasoning and tool selection.
* Support custom model endpoints for local LLMs and cloud-based APIs.
* Add dynamic function calling and context-aware orchestration logic.
4. Database & Storage
* Use Prisma ORM with SQLite (local) and PostgreSQL (production) support.
* Store:
    * Agent interactions
    * Run history and metrics
    * Tool usage logs and performance data
5. Frontend / UI
* Build a modern responsive interface using Tailwind CSS + React (or Next.js).
* Add:
    * Real-time progress tracking dashboard
    * Output view window for agent responses
    * Live visual runtime previews of agent activity
    * Interactive timeline view for task execution flow
6. Analytics & Testing
* Include analytics dashboard for:
    * Run history
    * Performance metrics
    * Error tracking and logs
* Use Jest for automated testing.
7. Production Quality
* Implement error handling, secure headers, and optimized builds.
* Include a .env configuration for API keys and DB connections.
* Ready for deployment on Replit, Vercel, or Render.

Bonus
* Add a real-time “Agent Visualizer” panel that shows live interactions between the 5 agents with task previews and color-coded progress.
* Enable users to type a goal or problem → system breaks it into tasks → executes automatically → displays live visual workflow and results.

Goal: Generate all essential files and code (frontend + backend + agent system + integrations + database schema) for a fully working RAJGpt orchestration app with live runtime visualization, output view window, and agent task previews.


Mission Statement: Transform ideas into exceptional digital experiences that users love and businesses depend on, through the perfect marriage of technical excellence and design mastery.
Core Promise: Every solution delivered will be production-ready, user-centered, technically robust, and designed to scale—representing the highest standards of modern digital product development.
